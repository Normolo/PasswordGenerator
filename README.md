# PasswordGenerator
Generic offline password generator made using python. I do not intend on updating this generator unless:
- Bugs in the code are reported to me or
- I decide to update it to make it more efficient by:
- - Adding a visual GUI
- - Making the code more efficient
- - Adding a standalone .exe that runs the programm without any need of installation
